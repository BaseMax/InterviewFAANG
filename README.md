# FAANG Interview

I took a Job offer from FB a few days ago to work as a Technical Lead, Senior Software engineer.
So I try to solve some Facebook interview and this was really cool for me.

## Solving Facebook interview questions
### Pretty Json

> Asked in: Facebook, Microsoft

Given a string A representating json object. Return an array of string denoting json object with proper indentaion.

Rules for proper indentaion:

- Every inner brace should increase one indentation to the following lines.
- Every close brace should decrease one indentation to the same line and the following lines.
- The indents can be increased with an additional ‘\t’

Note:

- `[]` and `{}` are only acceptable braces in this case.
- Assume for this problem that space characters can be done away with.


##### Input Format

The only argument given is the integer array A.

##### Output Format

Return a list of strings, where each entry corresponds to a single line. The strings should not have "\n" character in them.

##### For Example

```
Input 1:
    A = "{A:"B",C:{D:"E",F:{G:"H",I:"J"}}}"
Output 1:
    { 
        A:"B",
        C: 
        { 
            D:"E",
            F: 
            { 
                G:"H",
                I:"J"
            } 
        } 
    }

Input 2:
    A = ["foo", {"bar":["baz",null,1.0,2]}]
Output 2:
   [
        "foo", 
        {
            "bar":
            [
                "baz", 
                null, 
                1.0, 
                2
            ]
        }
    ]
```
